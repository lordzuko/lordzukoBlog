### Point of View (POV)

- Whether the narrator describes events in a personal or impersonal manner
- **Types of POV**
    - **1st Person:** The narrator is referring to himself and implies a direct, personal observation of events.
    - **2nd Person:** The narrator tells the reader what they are feeling or doing, giving the impression that the
    narrator is speaking specifically to the reader themselves and perhaps even controlling their actions. **[This is rare and therefore not much of a feature from ML point]**
    - **3rd Person:** The narrator is observing the story's course of action from outside. The narrator's thoughts or feelings are not referred.
  

### Diegesis

- Diegesis is whether the narrator is involved (**homodiegetic**) or not involved (**heterodiegetic**) in the story
    - **Homodiegetic:** The narrator is also a character of the story driving the plot forward
    - **Heterodiegetic:** The narrator is only an observer of action and not influencing the action
  

### **Corpus Distribution**
